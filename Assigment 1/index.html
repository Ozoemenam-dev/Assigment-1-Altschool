      <h2>Okpara Chidiebere</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Okpara Chidiebere, and I'm a backend engineering student at
        AltSchool Africa <cite>(student ID: ALT/SOE/023/3016)</cite> . Alongside
        my role as a lead solar engineer and project manager in Lagos, I've
        always been captivated by the fusion of technology and education.
        AltSchool's personalized learning approach and emphasis on student
        agency drew me in, fueling my passion for innovative educational
        methods. My primary goal at AltSchool is to deepen my understanding of
        technology's role in education. I'm particularly focused on honing my
        practical skills in backend programming. Collaborating with peers and
        mentors, I aim to foster a dynamic, student-centered learning
        environment. Ultimately, I envision utilizing my AltSchool experience to
        contribute to the development of educational technology that positively
        impacts students' learning worldwide.
